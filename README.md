# sculpt

A CLI tool for sculpting WP plugins quickly.

## Why Sculpt

Sculpt is a simple, but powerful CLI tool for building enterprise WP plugins very quickly. It uses simple commands to create standard WP features such as `Posts`, `Taxonomies`, `Meta Boxes`, `Routes`, `Menus` and so much more. In this way, you can focus more on the business logic of your WordPress plugin than spending time trying to write classes from scratch.

If you are a fan of Laravel and how it presents an Object-Oriented approach to building clean, robust and scalabale PHP applications using the `artisan make` commands, then you would definitely love **Sculpt**.

## Getting Started

Install via NPM like so:

```bash
npm install -g @badasswp/sculpt-cli
```

Now you should be able to run it from anywhere in your command like so:

```bash
sculpt
```
