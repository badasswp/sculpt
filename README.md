## Why Sculpt?

Sculpt is a simple, but powerful CLI tool for building enterprise WP plugins very quickly. It uses simple commands to create standard WP features such as `Posts`, `Taxonomies`, `Meta Boxes`, `Routes`, `Menus` and so much more. In this way, you can focus more on the business logic of your WordPress plugin than spending time trying to write classes from scratch.

If you are a fan of Laravel and how it presents an Object-Oriented approach to building clean, robust and scalabale PHP applications using the `artisan make` commands, then you would definitely love **Sculpt**.
